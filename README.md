# matrix-alg notes
My notes for matrices.

I'd recommend two ways to access these. You can view the images through the provided html viewer here: https://saffronner.github.io/matrix-alg-notes/. Or, download the repository and look at them through your image viewer. 

Careful: the current web viewer stretches the images to the width of the page. Resize your page to resize the images.
